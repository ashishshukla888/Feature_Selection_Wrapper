# Feature Selection using Wrapper Methods

Welcome to the repository on feature selection using wrapper methods. explore various wrapper methods for selecting the most relevant 
features in a dataset. Wrapper methods optimize feature subsets based on the performance of a specific ML model.

## Introduction

Feature selection is a critical step in building ML models. It involves selecting a subset of 
relevant features from the original feature set, which can lead to improved model performance and 
reduced overfitting. Wrapper methods are a category of feature selection techniques that evaluate 
feature subsets based on their impact on model performance.

four common wrapper methods: Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Exhaustive Search. 
Each of these methods uses a different strategy to select an optimal feature subset for a given ML model.

## Wrapper Methods

### Forward Selection

**Forward Selection** is a wrapper method that starts with an empty feature set and 
iteratively adds one feature at a time. It evaluates the performance of the model 
with each added feature and selects the best-performing subset.

### Backward Elimination

**Backward Elimination** is the reverse of Forward Selection. It starts with all features and 
removes one feature at a time in each iteration. It evaluates the performance of the model 
after removing each feature and selects the best subset.

### Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

**Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** is a recursive wrapper method that works by 
recursively fitting the model and ranking features based on their importance. It 
eliminates the least important feature in each iteration until the desired number 
of features is reached.

### Exhaustive Search

**Exhaustive Search** is a brute-force approach to feature selection. It evaluates all possible 
feature subsets and selects the one that yields the best model performance. While it guarantees 
finding the optimal subset, it can be computationally expensive for large feature sets.

## Usage

To use these wrapper methods for feature selection, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in 
this repository. The notebook demonstrates how to apply each method using Python and popular libraries 
like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
